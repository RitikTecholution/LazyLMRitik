<Instructions>
    1. **Identify Conversion Type:**
        - Determine the conversion type from the <Conversion_Type> input to guide the process.

    <Task-Independent_conversion>
    2. **Independent Conversion:**
        - **Objective:** Convert the current file without considering any dependencies.
        - **Procedure:**
            - Analyze the current file's code to understand its logic and structure.
            - Identify language-specific constructs and idioms that need adaptation.
            - Make sure you follow technology stack as per the <Technology_Stack> provided.
            - Translate these constructs into equivalent constructs in the target language.
            - Ensure the converted code maintains the original functionality.
            - For backend code, implement Swagger documentation for all API endpoints.
            - Validate the code against the target language's best practices and conventions.
            - Document any significant changes with comments in the code.
            - List any new packages, libraries, or modules used in the conversion process.

    <Task-Dependent_conversion>
    3. **Dependent Conversion:**
        - **Objective:** Convert the current file while ensuring compatibility with dependent files.
        - **Procedure:**
            - Analyze the current file and its dependencies listed in the <Dependency_Tree>.
            - Identify constructs that interact with dependent files and require adaptation.
            - Make sure you follow technology stack as per the <Technology_Stack> provided.
            - Convert the current file, ensuring it remains compatible with the target language.
            - For backend code, implement Swagger documentation for all API endpoints.
            - Review dependent files for any necessary changes to maintain compatibility.
            - Validate the entire set of files for functionality and adherence to best practices.
            - Document changes and potential issues in the code and dependencies.

    5. **Output Requirements:**
        - Return the converted code in the specified format.
        - Ensure the output starts with "```converted" and ends with "```".
        - Include a separate section for dependencies starting with "```dependencies" and ending with "```".

    6. **Validation:**
        - Verify that the converted code maintains the original functionality.
        - Ensure that the code adheres to the best practices and conventions of the target language.
        - For backend code, verify that Swagger documentation is correctly implemented.

    7. **Documentation:**
        - Provide comments in the converted code to explain any significant changes or adaptations.
        - Highlight any potential issues or considerations for further conversion steps.

    8. You will be provided with Coding Standards for the respective organization, under <Coding_Standards> which you have abide

    9. **Swagger Integration for Backend:**
        - When generating backend code, always integrate Swagger for API documentation.
        - Use Swagger annotations or decorators to document all API endpoints.
        - Ensure that the Swagger UI is properly set up and accessible.
        - Do not rely on separate swagger.json files; instead, use inline documentation and automatic Swagger UI generation.
        - For all frameworks, use their respective Swagger integration methods that support automatic documentation generation.
        
    10. **README.md File Generation Rules**:
    - If `code_type` is `documentation` ensure that you provide detailed on step on how to setup and start the project.
    
    11. **Uniformity**: 
    - You should follow the <Uniformity> section where it contains the uniformity rules followed for previous conversions.
    
</Instructions>

<Coding_Standards>
    Title: Handling API Keys in source code
Rule: API keys should be stored securely, avoiding direct inclusion in source code by utilising environment variables or secret management services.

<Glossary>
    - **Target_Language:** The programming language to which the file is being converted.
    - **Current_File:** The code of the file that needs conversion.
    - **Dependency_Tree:** A list of files that are dependent on the current file.
    - **Generated_Directory_Structure**: In the Generated_Directory_Structure you will find the directory structure on which you are working therefore write your code as per it only.
    - At the end of each code you are expected to generate a technically detailed summary of the code file above with all the classes, functions and etc. 
    - First in the summary you will generate the functionality of the code file which file it imports. and in the latter part you will give the classes, function (with their return variables) and etc. Make sure the summary is built as per the language's terminologies.
    - Summary must be enclosed inside of "```summary" and "```" delimiters
    - The summary should be a detailed technical overview that includes all functions, logic, variables, return types, classes, and other relevant elements. It should be comprehensive enough to allow another coder to understand and utilize the functionality of the file in a different context. Under 250 Tokens or 220 words
    - Your Points will be deducted in the score card if the <Output_Format> is not followed.
    - Your Points will be deducted in the score card if the <FileMappings> is not followed.
    - You also need to provide a uniformity section with start delimiters "```uniformity" and end delimiters "```" so that upcoming AI generated code will follow this.
    - Example why we require uniformity: 
        - Example 1: If you are using `camelCase` for variable declaration then you should use the same for all the variables in the code.
        - Example 2: If you are using `blueprints` to register the routes in Flask then you should use the same for all the routes.
        - Example 3: If you are using `async/await` for asynchronous operations then you should use the same for all the asynchronous operations.
    - Uniformity is section where we cumulatively add the rules and the added rules should not be repeated under ```uniformity``` delimiters.

    Coding practice for language typescript: 
<Code_Generation_Instructions_modular_languages>
    <Instructions>
        1. **Understand Folder Structure:**
            - For TypeScript with Node.js, keep source code in `src/` and build output in `dist/`.
            - For front-end TypeScript (React, Angular), organize components, services, and styles in the `src/` directory.
            - Use `tests/` or `__tests__/` for testing, following the folder structure.

        2. **Adhere to TypeScript Conventions:**
            - Follow **TypeScript**'s static typing system by defining types and interfaces for all objects and functions.
            - Use **ESLint** and **Prettier** to enforce coding standards and formatting.
            - Use **camelCase** for variables and function names, **PascalCase** for classes, and **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants.
            - Use **async/await** for handling asynchronous operations.

        3. **Entry Point Creation:**
            - For Node.js, the main entry point is typically `index.ts` or `app.ts`.
            - In front-end applications, use `index.tsx` for React components.
            - Ensure that TypeScript's `tsconfig.json` is properly configured to handle module resolution.

        4. **Dependency Management:**
            - Use **npm** or **yarn** to manage dependencies and include TypeScript typings (`@types/*`).
            - Keep a `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` to manage project settings.
            - If using React, Angular, or other frameworks, ensure the correct TypeScript definitions are installed.

        5. **Test Case Integration:**
            - Use **Jest**, **Mocha**, or **Jasmine** with **ts-jest** for running tests with TypeScript.
            - Place test files in `tests/` and ensure they are named `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`.
            - Use mocks and spies to test services and API interactions.

        6. **Build and Validation:**
            - Use **Webpack**, **Parcel**, or **Rollup** to bundle the application.
            - Use **Babel** with TypeScript for backward compatibility with older browsers.
            - Integrate TypeScript's `tsc` compiler for type checking.

        7. **Documentation:**
            - Use **TypeDoc** for generating documentation directly from TypeScript code.
            - Include detailed comments and JSDoc annotations for better code understanding.
            - Create a `README.md` with instructions for setting up and using the project.

        8. **Additional Practices:**
            - Leverage TypeScript's static typing for safety and productivity.
            - Use **Interfaces** and **Types** to define object shapes and function signatures.
            - Modularize your code into smaller, focused files.

Coding practice for language python: 
<Code_Generation_Instructions_modular_languages>
    <Instructions>
        1. **Understand Folder Structure:**
            - Use the provided folder structure to organize your Python project. 
            - Place source code in `src/` and tests in `tests/` or `test/` directories.
            - Ensure configuration files such as `config.py` or `.env` are in the designated directories.

        2. **Adhere to Python Conventions:**
            - Follow **PEP 8** coding standards for code style (e.g., naming conventions, indentation).
            - Use **docstrings** for documenting classes, functions, and methods.
            - Avoid using single-letter variable names except for loop indices.
            - Use **type hinting** wherever possible for better type safety.
            - Ensure that the code uses Python's built-in libraries efficiently.

        3. **Entry Point Creation:**
            - In Python, the main entry point is typically a file like `main.py`. 
            - Ensure that if the script is intended to be executed, the following structure is used:
                ```python
                if __name__ == "__main__":
                    main()
                ```
            - Avoid placing logic directly in the global scope.

        4. **Dependency Management:**
            - Use `pip` for dependency management. Maintain a `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` for dependencies.
            - If using virtual environments, use `venv` to isolate dependencies for your project.
            - Ensure that any third-party libraries are compatible with the project's version of Python.

        5. **Test Case Integration:**
            - Write unit tests using **unittest** or **pytest**.
            - Organize tests under `tests/` with a similar structure to the source code.
            - Use mocking for testing external dependencies or services.
            - Follow best practices for naming test files (`test_*.py`).
            - Example test:
                ```python
                def test_addition():
                    assert add(1, 2) == 3
                ```

        6. **Build and Validation:**
            - Use `pytest` or `unittest` to validate the code and run tests.
            - Integrate with **CI/CD** tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate tests and builds.
            - Ensure that your code passes all unit tests and integration tests.

        7. **Documentation:**
            - Include inline comments to explain complex logic.
            - Use **Sphinx** for generating project documentation from docstrings.
            - Create a `README.md` with detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project.
            - Include example usage of the module or API.

        8. **Additional Practices:**
            - Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
            - Use logging (`logging` module) for error handling and debugging.
            - Avoid using global variables. Pass data via function parameters instead.
