, but I cannot convert the file as requested because the current file content is not provided. The <Current_File> tag only contains the file path, not the actual code content. Without the code to analyze and convert, I cannot perform the conversion task.

To proceed with the conversion, I would need the actual content of the file located at "LazyLMRitik_TS_001/nbdev-template-1.1.2/00_core.ipynb". This file appears to be a Jupyter Notebook, which typically contains a mix of markdown and code cells.

Once the file content is provided, I can analyze it, convert it to the target language (which is currently listed as "Unknown" with Jupyter Notebook as the technology stack), and provide the converted code along with any necessary dependencies and a summary of the changes made.

If you can provide the content of the 00_core.ipynb file, I'll be happy to proceed with the conversion task
