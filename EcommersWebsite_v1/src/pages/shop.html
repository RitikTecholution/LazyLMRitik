d that you want me to convert the file at the path EcommersWebsite_v1/src/pages/shop.html. However, you haven't provided the actual content of this file. Without the source code, I cannot perform the conversion or provide a meaningful output.

To proceed with the conversion, I would need the HTML content of the shop.html file. Once you provide the source code, I can analyze it, make any necessary adjustments (although HTML to HTML conversion typically doesn't require many changes), and provide the converted code along with a summary of its functionality.

If you can provide the content of the shop.html file, I'd be happy to assist you with the conversion process and generate the required output format
