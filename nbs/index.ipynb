    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for a wide range of applications, from content creation to complex problem-solving. We've seen widespread adoption of language models as \"assistants\" in various domains, such as healthcare, education, and content creation. However, in educational contexts, these models often fall short of providing an optimal learning experience. They tend to generate complete solutions upfront, robbing students of the opportunity to engage in the step-by-step reasoning process that is crucial for deep understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises an important question: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Can we get these systems to evaluate in a 'Socratic' way?\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, can we develop systems that encourage students to *think* step-by-step, rather than generating complete solutions upfront?\n",
    "\n",
    "While there has been significant work on making LLMs reason step-by-step (e.g., chain-of-thought prompting), to our knowledge, there isn't an existing framework to build systems that allow users to think through problems step-by-step while having the LLM assist in a pedagogical way. This is where the concept of \"lazy evaluation\" in language models comes into play, offering a more Socratic approach to AI-assisted tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work demonstrates an approach to building a framework for forcing models to evaluate in a lazy way, drawing inspiration from functional programming concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation behind implementing lazy evaluation in language models stems from several key observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pedagogical Effectiveness**: Traditional tutoring methods often involve guiding students through problems step-by-step, allowing them to think critically and make connections on their own. AI tutors should aim to replicate this approach rather than simply providing answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resource Efficiency**: Generating complete solutions upfront is computationally expensive, especially for complex problems. A lazy evaluation approach can significantly reduce resource usage by generating only the necessary information on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adaptability**: Students have varying levels of understanding and may require different amounts of guidance. A lazy evaluation system can adapt to each student's needs, providing more or less detail as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Engagement**: By revealing information gradually, we can maintain student engagement and encourage active participation in the problem-solving process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-world Problem Solving**: In many real-world scenarios, solutions are not immediately apparent and must be approached incrementally. Training students to think in this way prepares them for challenges beyond the classroom.\n"

    "\n",
    "The concept of lazy evaluation is well-established in functional programming languages, where the evaluation of an expression is only done when the value of the expression is needed. This is also known as call-by-need. The contrast to this evaluation strategy is what's called \"eager\" or strict evaluation.\n",

    "The concept of lazy evaluation is well-established in functional programming languages, where the evaluation of an expression is only done when the value (or terminial) of the expression is needed. This is also known as call-by-need. The contrast of this evaluation strategy is what's called \"eager\" evaluation or strict evaluation. Eager evaluation evaluates all of the subexpressions of an expression regardless whether the value is used or not. For example the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "func :: int -> int -> int\n",
    "func a b = a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "will always just pass back the first argument to the function\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    ">> func (2+2) 100\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "We get `4` because we are passing back that expression as part of the function, therefore we need to evaluate it to print it to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what about this\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    ">>> func (2 + 2) (100^1000000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In an eager (or strict) language like python, the evaluation of that function would look something like this\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "func((2+2), (100^1000000))\n",
    "\n",
    "func( 4, (100^1000000) )\n",

    "func( 4, 10000000000000000000000000000.....)\n",
    "\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is a lot of wasted computation just for a function that returns the first argument!\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages that support lazy evaluation have an evaluation strategy that looks more like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "func((2+2), (100^1000000))\n",
    "\n",
    "(2 + 2)\n",

    "4\n",

    "### Lazy Evaluation in the Context of Language Models\n",
